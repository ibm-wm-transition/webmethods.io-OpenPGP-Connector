# webMethods.io-OpenPGP Connector
This is a webMethods.io community connector that uses the [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) protocol to perform encryption and decryption of string data. Two actions are supported: 
* Encrypt
* Decrypt

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This connector requires any [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/) version between 8.14.0 and 10.14.2.

**Note:** If you have installed any other Node version on your system, you can:
1. Use tools to switch between different versions of Node

  - For Windows, use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades).
  
  - For Mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Build your app using your existing Node version and then transpile your code using a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

The connector has been built with [wmiocli](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/developer_guide/connector_builder/#gsc.tab=0), webMethods.io's iPaaS Connector Builder CLI tool and [openpgp.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openpgp), a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. 

### Installing
1. Clone the repo `https://github.com/SoftwareAG/webmethods.io-OpenPGP-Connector.git`.
2. Run `npm install -g @webmethodsio/wmiocli`.
3. Login to your webMethods.io tenant using `wmio login`.
4. Execute `npm install` to get started.
5. Finally, execute `wmio deploy` to deploy this connector to your tenant.

Once deployed, itâ€™ll be automatically registered with webMethods.io Integration and will be available to you locally in the Connectors panel under the Services tab.

## Running the tests
To test, you can execute `wmio test`.

## Deployment
Execute `wmio deploy` to deploy this connector to your webMethods.io tenant. And `wmio unpublish` to unpublish the published connector app along with triggers and actions associated with the app.
